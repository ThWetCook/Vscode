# Vscode

These are (most of) the projects I have made with Vscode. A lot of the stuff is just me screwing around, so naturally, a lot of the stuff **DOESN'T WORK**. Some of these projects were made over a year ago and things have changed since then. Some code "might" be broken.

Everything is under MIT License.
